# Windows Remote Arduino
![](http://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/ArduinoUno_R3_Front_450px.jpg)

Using an Arduino as an extension of your app on the Raspberry Pi or Windows PC is an exciting way to quickly add GPIO and other interfaces to a UWP app on a device which may not otherwise support them. For example, you can use an Arduino in concert with a Raspberry Pi to perform analog IO, something the Pi lacks in its native GPIO implementation.

Windows Remote Arduino is also an opportunity to play with "big brain / little brain" scenarios where an application on an application processor (PC, Pi, Phone) does all the user interface interaction and network IO, and the little brain (Arduino) does more real-time operations such as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), pin toggling, and more.
